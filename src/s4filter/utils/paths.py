    Get the path to the directory a ts4script is located. By default, assumes the file
    is located at a depth of 2 (in the root of a package inside a compiled ts4script).

    Increase the depth if you are fetching the mod root from another level deep
    inside your mod, or running the mod decompiled.

    For example:
        - Scripts/lot51_core/__init__.py is at a depth of 2
        - Scripts/lot51_core/lib/zone.py is at a depth of 3

    Usage: get_mod_root(__file__)

    :param file: The path to the current file, usually __file__
    :param depth: The depth `file` is located relative to Mods folder.
